1) Setting up FreeTDS (www.freetds.org)

(more information from http://www.freetds.org/userguide/x1564.htm)

1.1) first build FreeTDS normally. 

$ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/freetds
$ make
$ su root
Password: 
$ make install

1.2) configure the freetds.conf
[ms2my]
host =  192.168.0.1
port = 1433
(you can use the tds version here also as told in the freetds sample conf file, but for SQL2000 it worked anyway)

2) Setting up PHP

2.1) Build PHP with support for "Sybase" 
$ cd php
$ ./configure --with-sybase=/usr/local/freetds
$ make
$ su root
Password: 
$ make install

In the "ms2my" you have to change this section:

$conf=Array("servername"=>"ms2my",
            "username"=>"(your MSSQL username here)",
            "password"=>"(your password here)");

Modify also the first line of "ms2my" to point to the right location of php executable, to test
whether everything works you should try an example:

ms2my [DATABASE NAME] "SHOW TABLES"

And that's it!
